# Linac Wire Scan Basic
Uses AcSys Python to execute wire scans under different device (typically quad) settings, supplied by an external file.  

# To-Do
- make the beta calculation more efficient & just calculate beta/gamma/etc. from the energy, rather than making it be provided
- do we have to be concerned about a "mostly" in WS impinging on beam when running two WSs? 
- expand to do the tomography data processing & analysis
- expand to do the tomography data calculation of what setpoints are needed, as well as the optimization? (optional?)
